Sometimes only a placename is provided.\n\nStructured representations of dateline-related information can also be expressed more explicitly using [[locationCreated]] (which represents where a work was created, e.g. where a news report was written).  For location depicted or described in the content, use [[contentLocation]].\n\nDateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some examples: \"BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.\", \"Paris, France\", \"December 19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington\", \"Beijing/Moscow\", \"QUEZON CITY, Philippines\".\n      ",
