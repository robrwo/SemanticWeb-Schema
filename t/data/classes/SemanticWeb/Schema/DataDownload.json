Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and \"knowledge graphs\". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.\n    \nThe [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. \n\nFor example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: \"mass spectrometry\" or \"nmr spectroscopy\" or \"colorimetry\" or \"immunofluorescence\". If the [[variableMeasured]] is \"depression rating\", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be \"Zung Scale\" or \"HAM-D\" or \"Beck Depression Inventory\". \n\nIf there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]].
