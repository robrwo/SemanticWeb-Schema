The general trend in web technology is towards [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established [[url]] property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all [[url]] markup to use [[mobileUrl]] for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily [[Product]] and [[Offer]]) have extra URLs hosted on an additional \"mobile site\" alongside the main one. It should not be taken as an endorsement of this publication style.\n    ",
