      "rdfs:comment" : "A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The property [[populationType]] is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a [[StatisticalPopulation]] representing all [[Person]]s with a [[homeLocation]] of East Podunk California would be described by applying the appropriate [[homeLocation]] and [[populationType]] properties to a [[StatisticalPopulation]] item that stands for that set of people.\nThe properties [[numConstraints]] and [[constraintProperty]] are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of \"population\" used here is the general sense of a statistical\npopulation, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a [[populationType]] of [[Event]] or [[NewsArticle]] could be used. See also [[Observation]], where a [[populationType]] such as [[Person]] or [[Event]] can be indicated directly. In most cases it may be better to use [[StatisticalVariable]] instead of [[StatisticalPopulation]].",
