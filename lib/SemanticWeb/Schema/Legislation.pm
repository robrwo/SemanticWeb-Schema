=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 C<jurisdiction>



Indicates a legal jurisdiction, e.g. of some legislation, or where some
government service is based.


A jurisdiction should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::AdministrativeArea']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_jurisdiction>

A predicate for the L</jurisdiction> attribute.

=cut

has jurisdiction => (

    predicate => '_has_jurisdiction',
    json_ld   => 'jurisdiction',
);


=head2 C<legislation_applies>

C<legislationApplies>

=begin html

<p>Indicates that this legislation (or part of a legislation) somehow
transfers another legislation in a different legislative context. This is
an informative link, and it has no legal value. For legally-binding links
of transposition, use the <a
href="/legislationTransposes">legislationTransposes</a> property. For
example an informative consolidated law of a European Union's member state
"applies" the consolidated version of the European Directive implemented in
it.</p>

the change. For consolidation relationships, use the <a
