=head1 DESCRIPTION

A schedule defines a repeating time period used to describe a regularly occurring L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Event>. At a minimum a schedule will specify [[repeatFrequency]] which describes the interval between occurrences of the event. Additional information can be provided to specify the schedule more precisely.
      This includes identifying the day(s) of the week or month when the recurring event will take place, in addition to its start and end time. Schedules may also
      have start and end dates to indicate when they are active, e.g. to define a limited calendar of events.



=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 C<by_day>

C<byDay>

Defines the day(s) of the week on which a recurring L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Event> takes place. May be specified using either L<SemanticWeb::Schema::DayOfWeek>, or alternatively L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Text> conforming to iCal's syntax for byDay recurrence rules.

A by_day should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::DayOfWeek']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_by_day>

A predicate for the L</by_day> attribute.

=cut

has by_day => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => '_has_by_day',
    json_ld   => 'byDay',
);


=head2 C<by_month>

C<byMonth>

Defines the month(s) of the year on which a recurring L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Event> takes place. Specified as an L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Integer> between 1-12. January is 1.

A by_month should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Integer']>

=back

=head2 C<_has_by_month>

A predicate for the L</by_month> attribute.

=cut

has by_month => (
    is        => 'rw',

    json_ld   => 'byMonth',
);


=head2 C<by_month_day>

C<byMonthDay>

Defines the day(s) of the month on which a recurring L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Event> takes place. Specified as an L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Integer> between 1-31.

A by_month_day should be one of the following types:

=back

=head2 C<_has_by_month_day>

A predicate for the L</by_month_day> attribute.

=cut

has by_month_day => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => '_has_by_month_day',
    json_ld   => 'byMonthDay',
);


=head2 C<by_month_week>

C<byMonthWeek>

Defines the week(s) of the month on which a recurring Event takes place.
Specified as an Integer between 1-5. For clarity, byMonthWeek is best used
in conjunction with byDay to indicate concepts like the first and third
Mondays of a month.


A by_month_week should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Integer']>

=back

=head2 C<_has_by_month_week>

A predicate for the L</by_month_week> attribute.

=cut

has by_month_week => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => '_has_by_month_week',
    json_ld   => 'byMonthWeek',
);


=head2 C<duration>



The duration of the item (movie, audio recording, event, etc.) in [ISO 8601
date format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).


A duration should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Duration']>

=back

=head2 C<_has_duration>

A predicate for the L</duration> attribute.

=cut

has duration => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => '_has_duration',
    json_ld   => 'duration',
);


=head2 C<end_date>

C<endDate>

The end date and time of the item (in [ISO 8601 date
format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)).


A end_date should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_end_date>

A predicate for the L</end_date> attribute.

=cut

has end_date => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => '_has_end_date',
    json_ld   => 'endDate',
);


=head2 C<end_time>

C<endTime>

The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g.
FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end. For
actions that span a period of time, when the action was performed. E.g.
John wrote a book from January to *December*. For media, including audio
and video, it's the time offset of the end of a clip within a larger file.
Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime, even
when describing dates with times. This situation may be clarified in future
revisions.


A end_time should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_end_time>

A predicate for the L</end_time> attribute.

=cut

has end_time => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => '_has_end_time',
    json_ld   => 'endTime',
);


=head2 C<except_date>

C<exceptDate>

Defines a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Date> or L<SemanticWeb::Schema::DateTime> during which a scheduled L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Event> will not take place. The property allows exceptions to
      a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Schedule> to be specified. If an exception is specified as a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::DateTime> then only the event that would have started at that specific date and time
      should be excluded from the schedule. If an exception is specified as a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Date> then any event that is scheduled for that 24 hour period should be
      excluded from the schedule. This allows a whole day to be excluded from the schedule without having to itemise every scheduled event.

A except_date should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_except_date>

A predicate for the L</except_date> attribute.

);


=head2 C<repeat_frequency>

C<repeatFrequency>

Defines the frequency at which L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Event>s will occur according to a schedule L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Schedule>. The intervals between
      events should be defined as a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Duration> of time.

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Duration']>

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_repeat_frequency>

    predicate => '_has_repeat_frequency',
    json_ld   => 'repeatFrequency',
);


=head2 C<schedule_timezone>

C<scheduleTimezone>

Indicates the timezone for which the time(s) indicated in the L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Schedule> are given. The value provided should be among those listed in the IANA Time Zone Database.
