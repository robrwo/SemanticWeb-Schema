The GS1 L<digital link specifications|https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/> express GTINs as URLs. A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a L<valid GS1 check digit|https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator> and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also L<GS1's GTIN Summary|http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin> and L<Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number> for more details.
