=head1 DESCRIPTION

A condition or factor that serves as a reason to withhold a certain medical
therapy. Contraindications can be absolute (there are no reasonable
circumstances for undertaking a course of action) or relative (the patient
is at higher risk of complications, but these risks may be outweighed by
other considerations or mitigated by other measures).
