=head2 C<additional_property>

C<additionalProperty>

A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the
entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there
is no matching property in schema.org. Note: Publishers should be aware
that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g.
http://schema.org/width, http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13,
...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties,
rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.

=head2 C<_has_additional_property>
