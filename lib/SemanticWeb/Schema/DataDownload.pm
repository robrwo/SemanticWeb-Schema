=head1 DESCRIPTION

All or part of a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Dataset> in downloadable form. 



=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 C<measurement_technique>

C<measurementTechnique>

A technique or technology used in a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Dataset> (or L<SemanticWeb::Schema::DataDownload>, L<SemanticWeb::Schema::DataCatalog>),
corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (described using [[variableMeasured]]). This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for dataset discovery.

For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence".

If the [[variableMeasured]] is "depression rating", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".

If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::PropertyValue> for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]].

A measurement_technique should be one of the following types:

=item C<Str>

=head2 C<_has_measurement_technique>

A predicate for the L</measurement_technique> attribute.

    predicate => '_has_measurement_technique',
    json_ld   => 'measurementTechnique',
