=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structured value providing information about the opening hours of a place or a certain service inside a place.

The place is B<open> if the [[opens]] property is specified, and B<closed> otherwise.

If the value for the [[closes]] property is less than the value for the [[opens]] property then the hour range is assumed to span over the next day.
