=head1 DESCRIPTION

An offer to transfer some rights to an item or to provide a service â for example, an offer to sell tickets to an event, to rent the DVD of a movie, to stream a TV show over the internet, to repair a motorcycle, or to loan a book.

Note: As the [[businessFunction]] property, which identifies the form of offer (e.g. sell, lease, repair, dispose), defaults to http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Sell; an Offer without a defined businessFunction value can be assumed to be an offer to sell.

For L<GTIN|http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin>-related fields, see L<Check Digit calculator|http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/support/check_digit_calculator> and L<validation guide|http://www.gs1us.org/resources/standards/gtin-validation-guide> from L<GS1|http://www.gs1.org/>.

The GS1 L<digital link specifications|https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/> express GTINs as URLs. A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a L<valid GS1 check digit|https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator> and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also L<GS1's GTIN Summary|http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin> and L<Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number> for more details.
