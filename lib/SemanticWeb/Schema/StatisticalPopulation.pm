=head1 DESCRIPTION

A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The property [[populationType]] is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::StatisticalPopulation> representing all L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Person>s with a [[homeLocation]] of East Podunk California would be described by applying the appropriate [[homeLocation]] and [[populationType]] properties to a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::StatisticalPopulation> item that stands for that set of people.
The properties [[numConstraints]] and [[constrainingProperty]] are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of "population" used here is the general sense of a statistical
population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a [[populationType]] of L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Event> or L<SemanticWeb::Schema::NewsArticle> could be used. See also L<SemanticWeb::Schema::Observation>, and the L<data and datasets|/docs/data-and-datasets.html> overview for more details.



=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 C<constraining_property>

C<constrainingProperty>

Indicates a property used as a constraint to define a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::StatisticalPopulation> with respect to the set of entities
  corresponding to an indicated type (via [[populationType]]).

A constraining_property should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Integer']>

=back

=head2 C<_has_constraining_property>

A predicate for the L</constraining_property> attribute.

=cut

has constraining_property => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => '_has_constraining_property',
    json_ld   => 'constrainingProperty',
);


=head2 C<num_constraints>

C<numConstraints>

Indicates the number of constraints (not counting [[populationType]]) defined for a particular L<SemanticWeb::Schema::StatisticalPopulation>. This helps applications understand if they have access to a sufficiently complete description of a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::StatisticalPopulation>.

A num_constraints should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Integer']>

=back

=head2 C<_has_num_constraints>

A predicate for the L</num_constraints> attribute.

=cut

has num_constraints => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => '_has_num_constraints',
    json_ld   => 'numConstraints',
);


=head2 C<population_type>

C<populationType>

Indicates the populationType common to all members of a L<SemanticWeb::Schema::StatisticalPopulation>.

A population_type should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Class']>

=back

=head2 C<_has_population_type>

A predicate for the L</population_type> attribute.

=cut

has population_type => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => '_has_population_type',
    json_ld   => 'populationType',
);
