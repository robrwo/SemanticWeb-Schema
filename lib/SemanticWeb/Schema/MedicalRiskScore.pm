=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple system that adds up the number of risk factors to yield a score
that is associated with prognosis, e.g. CHAD score, TIMI risk score.




=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 C<algorithm>



The algorithm or rules to follow to compute the score.


A algorithm should be one of the following types:

=over

=item C<Str>

=back

=head2 C<_has_algorithm>

A predicate for the L</algorithm> attribute.

=cut

has algorithm => (
    is        => 'rw',
    predicate => '_has_algorithm',
    json_ld   => 'algorithm',
);
