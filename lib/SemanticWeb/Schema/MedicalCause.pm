=head1 DESCRIPTION

The causative agent(s) that are responsible for the pathophysiologic
process that eventually results in a medical condition, symptom or sign. In
this schema, unless otherwise specified this is meant to be the proximate
cause of the medical condition, symptom or sign. The proximate cause is
defined as the causative agent that most directly results in the medical
condition, symptom or sign. For example, the HIV virus could be considered
a cause of AIDS. Or in a diagnostic context, if a patient fell and
sustained a hip fracture and two days later sustained a pulmonary embolism
which eventuated in a cardiac arrest, the cause of the cardiac arrest (the
proximate cause) would be the pulmonary embolism and not the fall. Medical
causes can include cardiovascular, chemical, dermatologic, endocrine,
environmental, gastroenterologic, genetic, hematologic, gynecologic,
iatrogenic, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurologic, nutritional,
obstetric, oncologic, otolaryngologic, pharmacologic, psychiatric,
pulmonary, renal, rheumatologic, toxic, traumatic, or urologic causes;
medical conditions can be causes as well.
