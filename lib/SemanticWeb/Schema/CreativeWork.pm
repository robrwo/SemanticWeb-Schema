Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some
CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a
specific schema.org release, e.g. ```10.0``` as a simple string, or more
explicitly via URL, ```http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0```. There
may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this
way, e.g.
```http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/``` but
this has not been carefully explored in the community.

=over

=item C<InstanceOf['SemanticWeb::Schema::Place']>

=head2 C<temporal_coverage>

C<temporalCoverage>

The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the
content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a
textual string indicating a time period in [ISO 8601 time interval
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals). In the case
of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a
precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be
written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book,
TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms
- textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may
sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 -
1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".
Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date.
For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and
with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in
future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.
